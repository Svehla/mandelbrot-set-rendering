# TODOs:
- add smart zooming to automatically increase resolution by CPU/GPU time power
- better colors intervals
- optimise step without zoom to calculate only new points (some memoization could be enough :thinking:) 
- calculate UI on the GPU via vertex shaders
- make nicer UI
- make zooming with the same resolution (something like ctrl+"+"/cmd+"+")
- make reset + persistent state in the localstorage
- add better readme.md
